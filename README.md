# Boids Simulation
Based on the example code for a flocking algorithm for [Processing.org](https://processing.org/examples/flocking.html)

Created by Daniel Shiffman as an "implementation of Craig Reynold's Boids program to simulate the flocking behavior of birds"

## Added
Ability to add obstacles that the boids will avoid.
Based on code by [jackperkins](https://github.com/jackaperkins/boids)
