# Boids Simulation
Based on the example code for a flocking algorithm for [Processing.org](https://processing.org/examples/flocking.html)

Created by Daniel Shiffman as an "implementation of Craig Reynold's Boids program to simulate the flocking behavior of birds"

## Added
Ability to add obstacles that the boids will avoid.
Based on code by [jackperkins](https://github.com/jackaperkins/boids)

## How to use
1. Download the 4 .pde files.
2. Download [Processing](https://processing.org/download)
3. Open the Boids.pde file in processing
4. Run the program
5. Use left click to add boids or right click to add obstacles
